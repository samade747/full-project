  "description": "Simulation is an indispensable tool in modern robotics development. It provides a virtual environment where robots can be tested, trained, and debugged without the risk of damaging expensive hardware or endangering humans. The ability to simulate a robot's behavior in a controlled and repeatable manner accelerates the development process and enables the exploration of complex scenarios that would be difficult or impossible to test in the real world.",
